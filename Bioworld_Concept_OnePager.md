# Bioworld — Concept One‑Pager
Date: 2025-09-22

## What it is
Open‑source, open‑world sandbox where systemic ecology and crafting react to player actions. PC first.

## Player fantasy
Build a working lab, shape an ecosystem, and engineer solutions with friends or solo. Real people in a near‑future, sci‑fi manga tone. Photoreal with subtle shadow for dystopian vibe.

## Audience
PC sandbox and builder players, ages 13+. Solo tinkerers and small groups. Streamer‑friendly.

## Design pillars
1) Systems over scripts. 2) Player authorship. 3) Readable complexity. 4) Open development.

## Core loop
Observe → Gather → Craft/Place → System reacts → Iterate and share. Pace=3. Difficulty=4.

## Progression
Knowledge and tool tiers gate access. No XP grind. Energy budget instead of hunger. Craft‑heavy (4/5).

## Combat
Opt‑in and positional. Combat weight=4/5. NPCs deal reduced damage; allied NPCs can be defended. Failure is local, not campaign‑ending.

## Modes
Solo viable. Coop 1–4 with exponential benefits for research items (papers, cells, CRISPR tools). Third‑person camera with optional first‑person toggle for aiming.

## World and systems
Biome‑driven simulation: wind, water, nutrients, temperature. Agents with needs (energy, safety, reproduction). Chain reactions across systems enable emergent solutions.

## Differentiators
- Shareable **Blueprint Codes** for builds. Portable, remixable content.
- **Reactive ecology chains** that surprise players.
- **Zero‑friction coop creation** with drop‑in/out and rejoin grace.
- **In‑game automation blocks** for farms and factories.
- **Weekly world seeds** to focus community experiments.
- **Research Companion app** for offline experiments and packet sharing.

## Monetization
None at launch. Optional cosmetics later. Mods and OSS builds allowed; they disable official stat tracking and real‑world progress.

## Tech
Unreal Engine 5.x. Lumen, Nanite, PCG, RVT, Niagara. Listen‑server coop in prototype. Git + LFS. Public roadmap.

## 90‑day prototype goals
Teach first craft in <7 min. Two observe→craft→react cycles in 15 min. Coop reconnect >95%.

## Success metrics
Day‑7 retention ≥40%. Avg 3+ “surprise interactions” per session. <16 ms 90th‑percentile hitch in slice.

## Risks and mitigations
Scope creep → MoSCoW and slice gates. Network complexity → listen‑server only. Performance → profiling and presets. Art throughput → PCG dressing and kits.

## Business fit
Open development builds community IP without heavy content spend. Shareable blueprints and weekly seeds drive UGC loops and organic reach.
